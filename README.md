This course [2026_probability_statistics_hypothesis_testing](https://github.com/jurtasun/2026_probability_statistics_hypothesis_testing) provides an introduction to the field of probability and statistical inference. The content of the course is currently being edited and revised by the [https://pressbooks.pub](https://pressbooks.pub) open-source platform. Meanwhile, please find the available pdf version of the notes `statistics_probability_course.pdf`.

The course is organized in five chapters, covering the topics listed below:

- Descriptive statistics
- Probability and random events
- Parameter estimation
- Introduction to hypothesis testing
- Introduction to Bayesian probability
- Appendix 1: Vectors and matrices: a quick review 
- Appendix 2: Functions and derivatives: a quick review 
- Appendix 3: Integrals: a quick review 

All will be followed by a practical session and hands-on coding, both in Python and R. No prior experience in statistics or programming is required for the attendance of this course. For exercises and detailed descriptions, the handwritten version of the *work-in-progress* chapters can be found at the appendices `statistics_probability_couse_app1.pdf` and `statistics_probability_course_app2.pdf`.

### Access the Open-Source content on `Github`:

These lecture notes are based on the content of the following courses at ECRI Imperial College London and MRC Laboratory of Medical Sciences:

- Introduction to sampling and hypothess testing
[Introduction to computational statistics](https://github.com/LMSBioinformatics/lms_computational_statistics/)

- Introduction to sampling and hypothess testing
[Introduction to sampling and hypothesis testing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/early-career-researcher-institute/learning-and-development/courses-by-programme/research-computing-and-data-science/sampling-hypothesis-testing/)

- Further hypothesis testing
[Further statistics and hypothesis testing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/early-career-researcher-institute/learning-and-development/courses-by-programme/research-computing-and-data-science/further-hypothesis-testing/)

The topics covered will include basic concepts on probability theory, inference, distributions, and hypothesis testing. 
The aim of these lecture notes course is to provide strong foundations at the mathematical and theoretical level, while providing practical exercises to work on real data.
